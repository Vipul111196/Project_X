### Follow the INSTRUCTION carefully:
You are an expert in **Domain** constructing a **knowledge graph**. Given a **Context** and **Ontologies defined in Natural Language**, perform the following tasks:

#### **Step 1: Extract Entities**
- Extract entities based on the **Natural Language Ontologies** defined below.
- For each entity, infer its type (class/label) as defined in the ontology.

#### **Step 2: Extract Relations**
- Use only the allowed relationship types defined in the ontology.

#### **Step 3: Generate Structured Triplets**
- Output a JSON list of dictionaries, each with the following fields:
  - `s`: Subject entity (string)
  - `p`: Predicate/relationship (string)
  - `o`: Object entity (string)
  - `stype`: Type/class of the subject (e.g., "Company", "FinancialMetric")
  - `otype`: Type/class of the object
  - (optional) `value`, `unitCode`, `reportNumber`, `temporalCoverage`, etc. if applicable

#### **Step 4: Output Format Rules**
- Return ONLY a **JSON list** of dictionaries with keys as described.
- Do not return text, explanation, or any extra formatting.
- If `Context` is empty or not meaningful, return `[]`.

#### Here is the Domain:
{domain}

#### Here is the Ontologies defined in Natural Language:
{nl_ontology}

#### Here is the Context:
{chunk_text}
