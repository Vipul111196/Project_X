### Follow the INSTRUCTION carefully:
You are an expert in **Domain** constructing a **knowledge graph**. Given a **Context** and **Ontologies defined in Natural Language**, **Entities Types**, **Relations Types** which is provided at the end, perform the following tasks:

#### **Step 1: Extract Relevant Entities**
- Extract entites based on the **Ontologies defined in Natural Language** provided below for the Given **Domain** and **Context**.

#### **Step 2: Use only and only the 7 predefined relation types, otherwise, you will be given penalty:**
- Extract relations based on the **Ontologies defined in Natural Language** provided below for the Given **Domain** and **Context**.

#### **Step 3: Identify Relationships and Generate Triplets**
- Determine the **relationships** between the *Entity Types** and the using the **triplet format**: (head_concept, relation, tail_concept)
    
- Relationship Directionality: 
    - Some relations are strictly directional, meaning (A, Evaluate-for, B) is valid, but (B, Evaluate-for, A) is not.
    - The relations "Compare" and "Conjunction" are bidirectional.
    - The query concept may be the head or tail in a triplet, but additional triplets between extracted concepts are encouraged.

#### **Step 4: Format the Output only and only use the given format, otherwise, you will be given penalty**
- Return ONLY and ONLY a list of triplets in this format: (concept, relation, concept)
- For Example:
    (natural language explanation, Used-for, model reasoning)
    (natural language explanation, Evaluate-for, classification performance)

#### Boundary Conditions:
- A tuple of triplet is considered eligible if it has only and only 3 items that is 2 concepts and one relationship between them

#### Important notes:
- No additional explanations, numbering, or extra text.
- If ### Content is empty, return None.
