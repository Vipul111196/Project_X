Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\\nintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nQuarterly Highlights\\nTotal net sales increased 2% or $1.5 billion during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of\\nServices and iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories.

Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\\nintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nQuarterly Highlights\\nTotal net sales increased 2% or $1.5 billion during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of\\nServices and iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories.

Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\\nintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nQuarterly Highlights\\nTotal net sales increased 2% or $1.5 billion during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of\\nServices and iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories.

This figure represents an increase of 2% compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of services and iPhone, though it was partially offset by lower sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The net sales breakdown for the quarter also showed that iPhone sales were $40,665 million, Mac sales were $7,382 million, iPad sales $7,224 million, Wearables, Home and Accessories sales were $8,084 million, and Services revenue stood at $19,604 million.\n",

      "  - iPhone sales increased by 3% to $40.67 billion compared to Q3 2021.\n",
      "  - Service revenue grew by 12% to $19.60 billion, highlighting a robust demand in this segment. \n",
      "  - However, segments like Mac and Wearables experienced a decline in sales.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Cost of Sales and Expenses**: The total cost of sales increased to $47.07 billion, resulting in a gross margin of $35.89 billion, compared to $35.26 billion in the prior year.\n",
      "- **Net Income**: The net income for this quarter was reported at $19.44 billion, a decrease from $21.74 billion in Q3 2021, while the diluted earnings per share (EPS) were down to $1.20 from $1.30.\n",
      "\n",
