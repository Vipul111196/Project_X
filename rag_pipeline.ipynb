Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\\nintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nQuarterly Highlights\\nTotal net sales increased 2% or $1.5 billion during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of\\nServices and iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories.

Net sales can also be affected when consumers\\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nQuarterly Highlights\\nTotal net sales increased 2% or $1.5 billion during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of\\nServices and iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories.
