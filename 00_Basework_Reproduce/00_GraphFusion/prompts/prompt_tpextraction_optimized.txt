### TASK: Knowledge Graph Triple Extraction in Computer Science and NLP

You are an expert in Computer Science and Natural Language Processing tasked with extracting structured knowledge from text.

### INPUT:
- Query Concept: {concept}
- Content: Academic text related to the query concept provided at the end

### EXTRACTION PROCESS:

#### Step 1: Identify Relevant Entities
Identify fine-grained concepts related to the query concept. Focus on:
- Specific techniques, models, frameworks, or algorithms
- Datasets, benchmarks, or evaluation metrics
- Research problems or tasks
- Properties or characteristics

#### Step 2: Determine Relationships
For each pair of concepts (including the query concept), determine if there is a meaningful relationship that can be represented as a triplet:
(head_concept, relation, tail_concept)

#### Step 3: Use Only These 7 Relation Types:
{relation_definitions}

IMPORTANT: 
- Be precise with relation directionality
- "Compare" and "Conjunction" are bidirectional
- All other relations have specific directions

### OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY triplets in this format with no extra text:
(concept, relation, concept)

### EXAMPLES:

For query concept "transformer models" with context about NLP applications:
(transformer models, Used-for, machine translation)
(transformer models, Compare, recurrent neural networks)
(attention mechanism, Part-of, transformer models)
(BERT, Hyponym-Of, transformer models)

### NOTES:
- Output ONLY valid triplets with no additional text
- Each triplet must use one of the 7 relation types exactly as specified
- If content is empty, return "None"

### QUERY CONCEPT: {concept}

### CONTENT:
{abstract}
