### Follow the INSTRUCTION carefully:
You are an expert in **Computer Science** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, tasked with constructing a **knowledge graph**. Given a **query concept: {concept}** and a **context** which is provided at the end, perform the following tasks:

#### **Step 1: Extract Relevant Concepts**
- Identify **fine-grained concepts** from the content that are relevant to the **query concept**.
- These concepts should be well-defined and typically found in:
  - **Lecture topics**
  - **Academic material sections**
  - **Wikipedia pages**
- Extracted concepts may include **subfields, techniques, tools, datasets, tasks, models, or evaluation metrics**.

#### **Step 2: Identify Relationships and Generate Triplets**
- Determine the **relationships** between the **query concept** and the **extracted concepts** using the **triplet format**: (head_concept, relation, tail_concept)

#### **Step 3: Use only and only the 7 predefined relation types, otherwise, you will be given penalty:**
    {relation_definitions}
    
- Relationship Directionality: 
    - Some relations are strictly directional, meaning (A, Evaluate-for, B) is valid, but (B, Evaluate-for, A) is not.
    - The relations "Compare" and "Conjunction" are bidirectional.
    - The query concept may be the head or tail in a triplet, but additional triplets between extracted concepts are encouraged.

#### **Step 3: Format the Output only and only use the given format, otherwise, you will be given penalty**
- Return ONLY and ONLY a list of triplets in this format: (concept, relation, concept)
- For Example:
    (natural language explanation, Used-for, model reasoning)
    (natural language explanation, Evaluate-for, classification performance)

#### Boundary Conditions:
- A tuple of triplet is considered eligible if it has only and only 3 items that is 2 concepts and one relationship between them

#### Important notes:
- No additional explanations, numbering, or extra text.
- If ### Content is empty, return None.

#### Here is the query concept: {concept}

#### Here is the content:
